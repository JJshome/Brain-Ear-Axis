## System Overview

The Brain-Ear Axis Analysis System is an integrated approach combining six key modules:

1. **Genomic Analysis Module (100)**: Analyzes genetic variants associated with ear diseases
2. **Microbiome Analysis Module (200)**: Examines microbiome composition in and around the ear
3. **Neural Signal Analysis Module (300)**: Monitors brain activity in response to auditory stimuli
4. **Integrated Data Processing Module (400)**: Combines data from multiple sources for comprehensive analysis
5. **Disease Localization Mapping Module (500)**: Creates 3D visualizations of ear pathologies
6. **Personalized Analysis Engine (600)**: Generates personalized treatment recommendations

## Implementation Status

This project is currently in development. The initial focus is on building the core infrastructure and individual analysis modules.
