# Integrated Data Processing Module (400)

This module implements the integrated data processing component of the Brain-Ear Axis Analysis System, which combines data from genomic, microbiome, and neural signal analyses to provide a comprehensive understanding of ear diseases.

## Components

### 1. Data Normalization Module (410)
- Standardization of heterogeneous data types
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Handling of missing values
- Quality control and filtering

### 2. Multi-omics Integration Analysis Module (420)
- Integration of genomic, microbiome, and neural data
- Factor analysis for dimension reduction
- Latent variable modeling
- Feature selection for integrated models

### 3. Bayesian Network Construction Module (430)
- Learning network structure from multi-modal data
- Parameter estimation for conditional probabilities
- Model evaluation and validation
- Visualization of probabilistic relationships

### 4. Causal Inference Module (440)
- Causal relationship discovery between variables
- Counterfactual analysis
- Mediation analysis
- Treatment effect estimation

## Key Capabilities

1. **Integrative Analysis**: Combining heterogeneous data types (genomic, microbiome, neural) to identify patterns and relationships that would not be apparent from individual data types alone.

2. **Mechanism Discovery**: Uncovering causal mechanisms and pathways involved in ear diseases through Bayesian network analysis and causal inference.

3. **Disease Subtyping**: Identifying disease subtypes based on integrated multi-omic profiles for more precise diagnosis and treatment planning.

4. **Biomarker Identification**: Discovery of novel biomarkers combining multiple data modalities for improved diagnosis and monitoring.
