# Genomic Analysis Module (100)

This module implements the genomic analysis component of the Brain-Ear Axis Analysis System, focusing on the identification and analysis of genetic variants associated with ear diseases.

## Components

### 1. DNA Extraction Module (110)
- Automated nucleic acid extraction protocols
- Quality control procedures
- Sample tracking and management

### 2. NGS Sequencing Module (120)
- Integration with sequencing platforms (Illumina, Oxford Nanopore)
- Support for whole genome, whole exome, and targeted panel sequencing
- Data preprocessing and quality filtering

### 3. Variant Detection Module (130)
- SNP and INDEL identification
- Structural variant detection
- Copy number variation analysis
- Variant annotation with gene and functional information

### 4. Machine Learning-based Disease Association Prediction Module (140)
- Pathogenicity prediction for identified variants
- Disease association scoring
- Gene-disease relationship modeling
- Polygenic risk score calculation

## Key Capabilities

1. **Identification of known ear disease-associated variants**: Detection of previously reported variants in genes related to ear diseases such as KCNE1, SLC26A4, GJB2, GJB6, and mitochondrial genes.

2. **Discovery of novel variants**: Identification of new variants potentially associated with ear diseases through comprehensive genomic analysis.

3. **Pathway analysis**: Assessment of affected biological pathways based on identified variants.

4. **Integration with other modules**: Providing genomic context for analysis by other modules in the Brain-Ear Axis Analysis System.
