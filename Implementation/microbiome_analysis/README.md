# Microbiome Analysis Module (200)

This module implements the microbiome analysis component of the Brain-Ear Axis Analysis System. It focuses on analyzing the microbial communities in and around the ear, as well as exploring the auditory-gut-brain axis.

## Components

### 1. Sample Preprocessing Module (210)
- Non-destructive DNA extraction protocols for ear samples
- Handling of different sample types (ear canal, middle ear, gut)
- Sample quality control and quantification
- Contamination control procedures

### 2. 16S rRNA Sequencing Module (220)
- Protocols for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (V3-V4 regions)
- Sequence preprocessing and quality filtering
- OTU clustering and ASV identification
- Taxonomic classification of microbiome profiles

### 3. Metagenome Analysis Module (230)
- Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing analysis
- Functional gene prediction and pathway analysis
- Microbial genome assembly and binning
- Strain-level identification of key microbes

### 4. Community Structure Analysis Module (240)
- Diversity analysis (alpha and beta diversity metrics)
- Ecological network analysis of microbial interactions
- Differential abundance testing between conditions
- Biomarker discovery using LEfSe algorithm

## Key Capabilities

1. **Characterization of ear microbiome profiles**: Identification and quantification of microbial communities in the ear canal and middle ear, with focus on pathogens and commensal bacteria relevant to ear health.

2. **Detection of dysbiosis patterns**: Identification of altered microbial communities associated with various ear disorders, including shifts in diversity and composition.

3. **Functional analysis**: Assessment of microbial functional potential related to inflammation, metabolism, and immune modulation in the ear environment.

4. **Auditory-Gut-Brain Axis analysis**: Investigation of connections between gut microbiome, systemic inflammation, and ear pathologies.
