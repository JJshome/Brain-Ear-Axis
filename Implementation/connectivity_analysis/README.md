## Components

### 1. Functional Connectivity Mapping
- Assessment of functional connectivity between brain and ear regions
- Correlation and coherence analysis of neural signals
- Dynamic connectivity mapping during auditory tasks
- Statistical analysis of connectivity patterns

### 2. Structural Connectivity Analysis
- Analysis of white matter tracts connecting auditory structures
- Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) processing
- Tractography of auditory pathways
- Quantification of structural connectivity metrics

### 3. Network Modeling
- Graph-theoretical analysis of brain-ear networks
- Hub identification and network topology assessment
- Community detection and module analysis
- Network resilience and efficiency metrics

### 4. Visualization and Interactive Analysis
- 3D visualization of connectivity networks
- Interactive exploration of brain-ear connections
- Time-series animation of dynamic connectivity
- Comparative visualization of normal vs. pathological connectivity

## Key Features

- Integration with neural signal analysis module
- Real-time connectivity assessment capabilities
- Multi-resolution connectivity analysis (from local circuits to global networks)
- Comparison between structural and functional connectivity patterns
- Identification of connectivity biomarkers for ear diseases
