# Infrastructure Module

This module provides the core infrastructure and utilities for the Brain-Ear Axis Analysis System. It includes data storage, management, API services, workflow orchestration, and user interface components.

## Components

### 1. Data Storage and Management

The data storage and management system handles various types of data:

- Genomic data (FASTQ/BAM formats)
- Neural imaging data (DICOM/NIfTI formats)
- Microbiome sequencing data
- Clinical and metadata
- Analysis results

### 2. API Services

RESTful API services for:

- Data upload and retrieval
- Analysis workflow execution
- Results visualization
- Authentication and authorization

### 3. Workflow Orchestration

Orchestrates the execution of analysis workflows across the different modules:

- Job scheduling and monitoring
- Resource allocation
- Error handling and recovery
- Pipeline versioning

### 4. User Interface Components

Components for the web-based user interface:

- Dashboard for system monitoring
- Data visualization components
- Analysis configuration forms
- Results presentation views
