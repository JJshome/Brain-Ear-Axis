# Diagnostic Methods for Brain-Ear Axis Evaluation

This directory contains research on diagnostic approaches and technologies used to evaluate the integrity and function of the brain-ear axis.

## Multimodal Diagnostic Approach

### Advanced Neuroimaging
- **Functional MRI (fMRI)**: Evaluates brain activity and functional connectivity in auditory and non-auditory networks
- **Micro-CT / Photon-Counting CT**: High-resolution anatomical imaging of inner ear, temporal bone, cochlear aqueduct, and IAC
- **Synchrotron Phase-Contrast Imaging**: Advanced technique for detailed visualization of temporal bone structures

### Electrophysiological Assessment
- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**: Measures neural activity with applications in tinnitus and other auditory disorders
- **Spectrum power analysis**: Examining delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands
- **Network connectivity features**: Assessing functional connections between brain regions
- **Electrically Evoked Auditory Brainstem Response (EABR)**: Evaluating auditory pathway integrity

### Genomic and Molecular Profiling
- **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**: Targeted sequencing, whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS)
- **Microbiome Characterization**: 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing
- **Biochemical Biomarkers**: Analysis of CSF and blood for markers of neuroinflammation and axonal damage
- **Perilymph Sampling**: Emerging technique for evaluating inner ear fluid composition

## Integrated Data Analysis Methods

- **Multi-omics Data Integration**: Combining genomic, microbiome, and biochemical data
- **Machine Learning Approaches**: Classification, prediction, and subtype discovery
- **Network Analysis**: Mapping connections between brain regions and ear structures
- **Causal Inference Modeling**: Understanding directional influences in the brain-ear axis

## Emerging Diagnostic Concepts

### Perilymph as a Diagnostic Window
- Potential for sampling perilymph to detect neurological disease markers
- Less invasive sampling techniques being developed
- Correlation between perilymph and CSF biomarkers

### Early Detection of Neurological Conditions
- Auditory symptoms as potential early indicators of neurological disorders
- Hearing loss as a "forme fruste" (early or atypical manifestation) of neurological disease
- Subtle changes in brain-ear axis potentially detectable before overt neurological symptoms

### Subtyping Disorders Based on Axis Function
- Characterizing ear disorders based on central vs. peripheral involvement
- Identifying disease mechanisms through biomarker patterns
- Potential for more targeted treatment approaches

## Clinical Implementation Challenges

- Translation gap between research tools and clinical practice
- Cost and accessibility of advanced diagnostic methods
- Standardization of protocols across centers
- Integration of findings into clinical decision-making
