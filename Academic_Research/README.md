# Brain-Ear Axis Research

This directory contains research materials on the brain-ear axis, focusing on the bidirectional communication pathways between the brain and inner ear, and their implications for otologic and neurological disorders.

## Directory Structure

1. **01_Anatomical_Connections**: Research on anatomical pathways connecting the brain and ear, including the cochlear aqueduct and internal auditory canal.

2. **02_Neuroinflammation**: Studies on neuroinflammatory processes in the brain-ear axis, focusing on how inflammation spreads between these systems.

3. **03_Auditory_Gut_Brain_Axis**: Exploration of the expanded concept of the auditory-gut-brain axis and its implications for systemic disease.

4. **04_Clinical_Applications**: Clinical studies and applications related to the brain-ear axis in various disorders like sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and Meniere's disease.

5. **05_Diagnostic_Methods**: Research on diagnostic methods and biomarkers for evaluating brain-ear axis function and pathology.

## Key Concepts

- Bidirectional communication between the brain and cochlea through fluid exchange and neural pathways
- Role of neuroinflammation in ear diseases and how brain inflammation can affect hearing
- Expanded model integrating gut microbiome influence on ear pathologies
- Diagnostic approaches for evaluating brain-ear axis integrity
- Clinical applications and potential therapeutic targets
